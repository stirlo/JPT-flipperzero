The Three Daily Prayers discusses the origins and development of the three daily prayers in Judaism - morning, afternoon, and evening. The tradition began with the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob each introducing a prayer time representing their qualities. Over time, sages like Ezra standardized the texts and rituals, such as the core eighteen blessings prayer, to be recited by all Jews three times daily in line with temple sacrifices.

+ Jewish law requires praying three times daily - in the morning, afternoon, and evening. These prayers are called Shacharit, Minchah, and Maariv/Arvith respectively.
+ The custom of praying three times a day originated from the three patriarchs - Abraham introduced morning prayer, Isaac afternoon prayer, and Jacob added the evening prayer.
+ Each patriarch represented a different quality in serving God - Abraham with love, Isaac with awe, Jacob with mercy.
+ We inherit these qualities from our patriarchs and can serve God with love, fear and mercy through prayer.
+ The Torah commands serving God with all our heart and soul, which we fulfill through prayer.
+ For the first 1000 years, there was no set prayer order - individuals prayed as they chose.
+ Temple sacrifices corresponded to daily and festival prayers and sacrifices.
+ After the temple's destruction, Jews continued congregational prayer in "small sanctuaries."
+ Ezra and the Men of the Great Assembly established the fixed daily 18-blessing prayer after the exile.
+ Over centuries, our sages formulated the basic structure of morning, afternoon, evening and holiday prayers as we have them today.
